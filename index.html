<p>My main research interest is genetics and genomics of complex human diseases and traits. I use genetic associations and omics approaches to discover underlying pathways and reveal predictive biomarkers. I am particularly interested in genetics of pain syndromes, allergy, and infectious disorders. Most recent projects included large-scale genetic and omics studies of low back pain, chronic widespread pain, fatigue, intervertebral disc degeneration, and hearing loss.</p>
